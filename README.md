--- 
Trial 1:  using bin liners and join with tape and/or sewing.  

Material including two 50L liners as body and one 30L bin liner as sleeve.  
Procedure as follows:

a.   Pattern of isolation gown:

Mark the liner piece with the above pattern, allowing 1cm and 3cm extra width for edges where the piece would be join with other edges.  Cut the liners according to the marks.

b.  join the sleeve to the body with adhesive tape, like stationary clear tape or painter's masking tape.  It may helps to use a round cylindrical object to hold the position of the sleeve in perpendicular to the body.  I use a 19cm diameter (8") baking tin for cake.  Otherwise a plastic bin may do the same trick.  Apple tape to the seam like this ![picture](docs/applyingTapeOnJoint.png).
